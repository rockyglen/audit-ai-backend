It includes the following components:  \n- CSF Core , the nucleus of the CSF, which is a taxonomy of high-level cybersecurity outcomes that can help any organization manage its cybersecurity risks. The CSF Core components are a hierarchy of Functions, Categories, and Subcategories that detail each outcome. These outcomes can be understood by a broad audience, including executives, managers, and practitioners, regardless of their cybersecurity expertise. Because the outcomes are sector-, country-, and technology-neutral, they provide an organization with the flexibility needed to address its unique risks, technologies, and mission considerations.\n- CSF Organizational Profiles , which are a mechanism for describing an organization's current and/or target cybersecurity posture in terms of the CSF Core's outcomes."", '[NIST CSF | Abstract | ]\n## Abstract  \nThe NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 provides guidance to industry, government agencies, and other organizations to manage cybersecurity risks. It offers a taxonomy of highlevel cybersecurity outcomes that can be used by any organization - regardless of its size, sector, or maturity - to better understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate its cybersecurity efforts. The CSF does not prescribe how outcomes should be achieved. Rather, it links to online resources that provide additional guidance on practices and controls that could be used to achieve those outcomes. This document describes CSF 2.0, its components, and some of the many ways that it can be used.', '[NIST CSF | Acknowledgments | ]\n## Acknowledgments  \nThe CSF is the result of a multi-year collaborative effort across industry, academia, and government in the United States and around the world.

A contemporary example is artificial intelligence (AI), which has cybersecurity and privacy risks, as well as many other types of risk. The NIST Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) was developed to help address these risks. Treating AI risks alongside other enterprise risks (e.g., financial, cybersecurity, reputational, and privacy) will yield a more integrated outcome and organizational efficiencies. Cybersecurity and privacy risk management considerations and approaches are applicable to the design, development, deployment, evaluation, and use of AI systems.

Some organizations integrate ICT and all other risk management efforts at a high level by using ERM, while others keep the efforts separate to ensure adequate attention on each. Small  \norganizations by their nature may monitor risk at the enterprise level, while larger companies may maintain separate risk management efforts integrated into the ERM.  \nOrganizations can employ an ERM approach to balance a portfolio of risk considerations, including cybersecurity, and make informed decisions.
